- Done as a part of the [MIT 6.824 - Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) course.
- Robust and highly tested RAFT consensus algorithm with persistence, snap-shotting, log compaction and conflict detection optimizations.
- Sharded Key-Value store built on top of RAFT, that can migrate shards dynamically with **zero downtime**.
