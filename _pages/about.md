<!-- You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

I am a mathematics and computing undergrad at IIT-D, currently in my final year. I have worked as an intern at [D.E. Shaw India](https://www.deshawindia.com/) and [IoTIoT.in](https://iotiot.in/).  
I enjoy learning about and building all kinds of systems. I love building automation scripts using python.
